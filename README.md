## About Me

My name is Dominik Brader and I am a FullStack PHP developer with experience in PHP frameworks such as Symfony and Laravel and experience in frontend frameworks such as Angular and Vue. Currently I am working as Lead Plugin Developer at FINDOLOGIC GmbH.

In my freetime I like to build new applications and try out new stuff. This way I am always up to date with the latest technologies, while learning all the cool new features/frameworks or dependencies.

### Frameworks & Personal Opinions

Many people do not like PHP, but I think it is awesome. While it has it hiccups, it also provides a great way to bring cool stuff to the end user. I would not recommend it as a templating engine (which it was initially designed for), but if you want, there is also [twig](https://twig.symfony.com/).

Personally PHP is really nice when you want to create an API, especially with something like [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) or [API-Platform](https://api-platform.com/).  
The frontend can be anything, but I personally suggest [Angular](https://angular.io/) if you are starting from scatch. While it is sometimes really frustrating to work with, and it has a really steep leaning curve, it has the best guidance on how the project should be structured and built. Everything is designed to build a frontend application (both for web and apps with PWA).  
I also highly recommend to check-out [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). It is one of the most flexable frontend libaries, as it can be directly integrated into any application and you get the full power of Vue, even if that means that Vue will only be used on a single page, or that Vue is only being used for a single component.

### Freetime Activities

As I've already mentioned in the "About me" section, I like to code also in my freetime. This doesn't mean that I am coding all day and all night in my basement. I love swimming, but due to Corona it is currently really hard for me to actually go for this hobby. Other activities include meeting up with my friends (which mostly do not know anything about coding) and playing online games (mostly with a compedetive focus - I like to compeat!).
